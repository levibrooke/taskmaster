# TaskMaster
CF 401 Lab 26: NoSQL and DynamoDB

## Description
Today, you’ll start building a new application called TaskMaster. It’s a task-tracking application with the same basic goal as Trello: allow users to keep track of tasks to be done and their status. While we’ll start today with a basic feature set, we will continue building out the capabilities of this application over time.
